README for hexsed

hexsed - a stream editor that uses data in hex format for the string
to delete or strings to find and replace.

There are options to generate the hex data without needing to actually
manually enter the hex data at all, eg:
tofind=`hexsed -s 'string to find'`
torepl=`hexsed -s 'replacement string'`
hexsed /"$tofind"/"$torepl"/s somefile
You may embed escape sequences within the character strings to be output
in hex format. Eg '\n' will generate '10' the value of a line feed.
This program is not a line editor. Nor does it use regular expressions.
It works on simple patterns with the addition of escape sequences.
Consequently, it gets it's main use for editing marked up data such as
XML/HTML. It is quite easy to operate on patterns that span several
lines. You may also restrict the number of times that a replacement or
deletion operation may happen, eg:
todel=`hexsed 'get rid of this just once'`
hexsed =1 /"$todel"/d somefile

FUTURE
There will be an option -u, --unicode, to output the hex bytes
represented by data like <U+2048>.
Also there will be commands 'a', append the replacement string to the
search string, 'i', insert the replacement string before the search
string, and 'p', print only the lines containing the search string.
It will also be able to restrict the editing operations to a selected
group of lines by line number.
